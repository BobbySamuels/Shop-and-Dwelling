Shop and Dwelling (SaD) is a studio and home with storefront visibility on Brunswick Street in North Fitzroy. A place for ‘work’ to be displayed to the public, SaD also represents a project that aims to push the creative potential of what working in a shop can be.

For SaD’s official opening as a project space, they would like to share a garment, which is the result of a collaboration with (link: https://articlesofclothing.com.au/ text: Articles of Clothing). AoC and SaD have designed a uniform that represents the extension of the shop to the public.

We would like to invite you to experience the space and the garment with us from 6pm on the 10th of May.

Alcohol will be provided generously by Young Henrys.

The shop is wheelchair accessible.

Shop and Dwelling acknowledge the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation as the rightful custodians of where this event takes place and that sovereignty was never ceded. We pay our respects to their elders past, present and emerging, as well as to all Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islanders' ongoing resistance against colonisation.
